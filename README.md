### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Diego Bullor and this is my GitHub

I'm 35 years old. I live in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, I love the idea of learning new things every day. I like to work in a team, I'm a positive and organized person.

I seek to grow both professionally and personally, so I am open to changes that arise in the different processes.

I like trekking, going to the mountains, to the river. I love listening to music.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 4Geeks Academy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more JavaScript and Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Back-End and Front-End projects.
